Front matter of the current page:

```yaml
layout: libdoc_page
```

I am to simpliest way to create a page into [Eleventy LibDoc](/content/index.md).

Be aware that this makes naturally orphan pages. This page is not linked into the primary navigation and has no breadcrumb. It must be linked somewhere to be accessed.

Go back to [Front matter minimal](/content/front-matter/minimal.md).
