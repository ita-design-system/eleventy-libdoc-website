Default Open Graph URL is the [LibDoc’s Open Graph image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ita-design-system/ita-medias/refs/heads/main/ogimage-11ty-libdoc.png). To assign your own default Open Graph URL, enter it into `settings.json`:

```json
{
    "ogImageUrl": "https://<YOUR_OWN_PUBLIC_ABSOLUTE_URL>.jpg"
}
```

The Open Graph Image is a metadata image URL that is displayed when a link to a LibDoc page is shared into a social network. By default, LibDoc configation `ogImageUrl` is used on every page but this parameter can be overridden on each page’s front matter with the same key `ogImageUrl`. Then you can customize each page of your project.

        For technical reasons, the Open Graph URL <strong>must</strong> be an image ready to be displayed and not a source image to be transcoded by Eleventy Image plugin.

<aside>
    <p class="alert alert-info" data-title="Local issues">
        Since the Open Graph Image URL must be set before site is deployed, the image may not be available on local development environment. A solution to this issue is to place custom Open Graph Images on another server.

Open Graph Image URL is applied following these ordered priorities:

1. By default Open Graph Image URL’s value is `libdocConfig.ogImageUrl` if nothing is set into the front matter.
1. If `ogImageUrl` is set into the front matter and the page is not a [blog post](/content/creating-content/blogging.md), page’s Open Graph Image URL gets this value.
