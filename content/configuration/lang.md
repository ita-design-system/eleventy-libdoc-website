`settings.json` defines the language applied on the entire website. **Default language is english (en)**. Every <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> text string of Eleventy LibDoc is stored as a key into `_data/libdocMessages.json`. This can be easily extended with more languages.

Example of `settings.json` file with french language set:

```json
{
    "lang": "fr"
}
```
