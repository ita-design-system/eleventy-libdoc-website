    * *Standard search*: find the exact query of the typed characters.
    * *Fuzzy search*: quickly find any page by typing some characters even in wrong order.
* **Keyboard shortcut ðŸ†‚** makes focus on search input.
* Improved search occurrence display.
* Improved display for popups.
* Improved no javascript display for code.
* Added Italian language translation <https://github.com/ita-design-system/eleventy-libdoc/pull/27>

Fixed:

* Search results skeleton does not display at the right moment.
