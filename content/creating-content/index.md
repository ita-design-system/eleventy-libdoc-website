description: How LibDoc can display your content in multiple ways
---
LibDoc supports every [language](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/) supported by Eleventy.

However, LibDoc was developed to easily write documentation, thatâ€™s why recommended languages to use with LibDoc are markdown `.md` and <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Markdown files can be mixed with HTML. In addition, dedicated pre-made HTML code collection is available as [widgets](/content/creating-content/widgets/index.md).

* [Markdown](/content/creating-content/markdown.md) for common semantics and syntax.
* [Inline HTML](/content/creating-content/inline-html.md) to enhance markdown unsupported semantics
* [Widgets](/content/creating-content/widgets/index.md) for advanced and specific usages.
